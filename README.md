Introduction: 
Hi everyone, 
I just want to let everyone know that most of my deep multi-layer Linux Administrator knowledge comes from two books. 
This is one of them: https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/101-500/. Most of the topics and skills used on this project,
are studied, learned, and practiced from Linux Professional Institute (LPI). Also, I highly recommend learning Linux from the beginning. 
Start from the buttom ground and learn up. You maybe surprised on what you know verse how the book clearly break down technologies.

Description: 
This project installs a Linux operating system (OS) on a external hard drive (HD). This project
should help your understand, Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), Master Boot Record (MBR) vs GUID Partition Table (GPT),
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), and OS file system types.
We will be manually configuring the OS that is being install to the HD. Again, topic can be better understood 
by using LPI's book: https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/101-500/
Featuresfeatures: List key features, What problem does it solve? Any highlights that make it stand out

Technologies Used: This is what I am using to install Linux OS.
Window 11 OS on a laptop
Linux kernal with distribution (I am using: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2))
Distributions: Debian (Package Manager) and Ubuntu (File & System file management)
A second monitor screen
I recommend using a Linux native OS vs WSL2

Prerequisites: List things the user needs before they can run or install your project

Installation: Step-by-step guide to set up the project.

Usage: Show how to use the project after installation
